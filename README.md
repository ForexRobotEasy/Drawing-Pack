# Drawing Pack

The Drawing Pack is a code developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team to optimize forex analysis with dynamic tools. It provides a set of drawing tools that can be customized and used to analyze market conditions and meet user-defined criteria. This code aims to enhance the trading experience by allowing users to create and save multiple drawings, customize each drawing's color, style, width, and font size, and implement an alert system based on specific market conditions or user-defined criteria.

This code can be used in the MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) platform. It is important to note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in the product. To find the official developer and obtain the complete product, please refer to the MQL5 website.
